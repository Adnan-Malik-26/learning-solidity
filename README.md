## ⚡ Prerequisites

Before running the examples, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for development and testing)
- [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (for interacting with deployed contracts)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Adnan-Malik-26/solidity-learning.git
   cd solidity-learning
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Compile Smart Contracts**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
4. **Run Tests**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat test
   ```
5. **Deploy Contracts (Local/Testnet)**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```
